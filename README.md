## ExchangeRate API

-   If you want to run this locally and see the exchange rates. For now the api being used to make these requests is https://www.exchangerate-api.com/
    you'll have to create an account there and get an api key from your account. Create a .env file in server directory and make an environment variable API_KEY

```shell
API_KEY='<YOUR API KEY HERE>'
```
